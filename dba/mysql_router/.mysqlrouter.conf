# MySQL Router sample configuration
#
# The following is a sample configuration file which shows
# most of the plugins available and most of their options.
#
# The paths used are defaults and should be adapted based
# on how MySQL Router was installed, for example, using the
# CMake option CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
#
# The logging_folder is kept empty so message go to the
# console.
